SUPPORT
    The intent of the "Alien-Build" team is to support as best as possible
    all Perls from 5.8.4 to the latest production version. So long as they
    are also supported by the Perl toolchain.

    Please feel encouraged to report issues that you encounter to the
    project GitHub Issue tracker:

    <https://github.com/Perl5-Alien/Alien-Build/issues>

    Better if you can fix the issue yourself, please feel encouraged to open
    pull-request on the project GitHub:

    <https://github.com/Perl5-Alien/Alien-Build/pulls>

    If you are confounded and have questions, join us on the "#native"
    channel on irc.perl.org. The "Alien-Build" developers frequent this
    channel and can probably help point you in the right direction. If you
    don't have an IRC client handy, you can use this web interface:

    <https://chat.mibbit.com/?channel=%23native&server=irc.perl.org>
